            <h3>My story ...</h3>
            <p>Life is too short for considering an option to venture yourself later. At the age of 16 with all grown fascination for the subject science and with all budding knowledge gained about computer systems through "minimum requirements to install" listed at the back cover of the CD games , led me to connect my dots towards Engineering.Many people believe to somehow already know what they truly want to become.But I believe and have had experienced that the dots which you connect and venture in the "process" gives you a more  perceptable picture.Even the great visionary steve jobs have said that "You can never connect your dots looking forward But you can always connect them looking backwards".
                Starting off with newly launched software "android" supporting smart adaptive games like "talking tom" ,  was something that took my attention for such applications and with internet burgeoning it's demand and reliance for almost everything worked parallely and introduced  me to Information system and Technology department for Engineering.As always being fascinated with the UI and the design ,In second year of engineering I was introduced with the subject Internet programming,My budding interest in Front end visuals  encouraged me to get hands on with HTML CSS and javascript with the help of some online courses.Simultaneously I developed a website"Purrfect Match" for adoption of dogs as my project of my subject Internet Programming.As I proceeded with the bootcamp of web development and gaining some rudimentary knowledge about backend coding with javascript.I went ahead with an encouragement as well as with a curiosity to learn a computer language,starting with C,Java ,nodejs and then concluding with python.
                Diverging from my intented specfic departmental field of interest I was hypnotized with a device named "arduino" which was almost equivalent to  mini computer, Having the capablity of executing limitless functions which was jawdropping.Soon I developed a mini project (Hand gesture vocalizer) to venture it's functionality.Later, This knowledge was beneficial for me to help me with my IOT related mini projects.As digging deep in with my passing semesters , Data mining was something that was new and the most basic subject was introduced, which has been the building tool of our very future IT world.This pushed me to venture different machine learning models and it's application towards deep learning(Analytics).Being amazed by the wisdom of computer in providing analytics using the analysis study I was sure by the semester 6 that my final year project has to be on Analytics.
                Currently i am at  7th semster of my  4 th year of engineering working on my final year project "Competitive E-commerce Analytics" which is a service almost required by any company ,that is to first understand it's primary competition and acheive it's statistics in no time.My main goal for this project is to make a business person to get hold of all the information about it's adaptive competition around with analytics (recommended decisions to take) and develop a beautiful user friendly dashboard by using all my gained knowledge of front end development.Looking back connecting my dots i could now perceive to move forward towards my next dot ( MS in information systems).
                Apart from my curiculum,I always have been into music since my growing age ,At the age of  12 performing first time on  stage with a guitar strapped on,will always be one of my best memories recorded in dairy.From then being the noobie to now being the Music coordinatior of my college(Vidyalankar Institute of technology) band has not only helped me to develop my interest and knowledge in music but also parallely has worked to develop leadership qualities,interpersonal skills and Time management.Music has been one of the factor for mending myself towards certain managerial skills.
